# text-to-image-stable-diffusion
This project is about making an text to image app using one of the most amazing and expensive models of time - Stable Diffusion

## Model 
The project uses the pretrained model: `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4` 

It can be found here: https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4

**Note** - It is important to note that this is a heavy model therefore it uses a lot of computational power. Therefore try to use a GPU (mine was GTX 2050)

## Stack
1. Python
2. Tkinter
3. Customtkinter
4. PyTorch
5. Hugging Face - diffusers

## Run
1. Download the zip file and unzip it
2. Make sure that you have all the necessary packages installed
3. Go to the project directory and open the terminal
4. Write the command - `python3 app.py` to run
5. Enter the name of the image you want to search, wait and you are readt to go
